My first React app, a simple Trivia using the <a href=https://opentdb.com/> Open Trivia Database API </a>. I didn't know much about APIs and asynchronous functions at the time, so I faced some issues syncing the current API call with the rendered questions. Not much to say really, everything else was just a matter of applying the React hooks fundamentals.  It's a single page App that renders the second page upon reception of the API, loops through an array of questions and randomly shuffles the answers around.
